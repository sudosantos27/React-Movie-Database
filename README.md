react-router: React Router is a popular JavaScript library for routing in React applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to manage and handle navigation within a React application.

React Router provides components that allow you to define the different routes in your application and render the appropriate components for each route. For example, you can define a route for the homepage, another route for the about page, and so on. When a user navigates to a specific route, React Router will render the corresponding component for that route.

React Router also provides features like URL parameters, nested routes, and redirects, which allow you to build complex navigation systems with ease.

In summary, React Router makes it easy to manage and handle navigation in a React application, making it a popular choice for many React developers

npm install history react-router-dom@next

Styled Components is a CSS-in-JS library for React that allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It provides a way to write component-specific styles, instead of writing global styles that affect the whole document.

Styled Components work by creating a new component for each style that you write.

npm i styled-components

prop-types is a library for checking the types of properties (also known as props) passed to React components. It allows you to specify the expected data types for the props that a component receives, and it will check those types at runtime to make sure that the props being passed to the component are valid.

npm i prop-types
